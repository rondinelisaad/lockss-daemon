Peri-articular osteopenia was the commonest radiological finding. The frequency of cases with hypercholesterolemia, hyper triglyceridemia and low HDL value was 13.33%, 16.67% and 70.67% respectively. There was no significant difference found between cases and controls in regards to serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, HDL, LDL, VLDL levels, TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratio. In different types of arthritis, there was a statistically significant difference was found in the mean HDL levels while no significant difference in the mean of TC, LDL, VLDL, and triglyceride levels.</p>

            <p id="paragraph-6159d6dab0ca4a31bc40c51b23c24173">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease affecting primarily the synovium, leading to joint damage, bone destruction and its affecting around 0.5%-1% of the adult population worldwide.<xref id="xref-3984bb5ce2004960ad06bd814c8cbd0c" rid="R62107014520146" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Epidemiological studies have shown an increased premature mortality in patients with RA compared with the general population.<xref id="x-e4748b58bf31" rid="R62107014520147" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>  RA is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is largely attributed to accelerated atherosclerosis. Both traditional and novel risk factors have been invoked to explain the accelerated atherogenesis in RA.<xref id="x-1245f5ce77a5" rid="R62107014520148" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>  However the risk factors for atherosclerotic events and cardiovascular disease include male sex, increased age, elevated plasma total cholesterol (TC) and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high blood pressure, smoking and diabetes mellitus.<xref id="x-c9d435e572e5" rid="R62107014520149" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>  Approximately 50% of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) in the community occurs in the absence of traditional risk factors. </p>
            <p id="paragraph-05a6085239984e789923675d502e5d97">Studies have shown that patients with untreated RA have dyslipidemia that contributes to atherosclerosis and that this atherogenic lipid profile can be positively influenced by the use of disease-modifying antirhumatic drugs (DMARD) therapy. Some studies have also shown ethni c differences in this respect.<xref rid="R62107014520150" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R62107014520151" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R62107014520149" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Majority of the reports of the prevalence of dyslipidemia in RA have been from Western countries with only an occasional small study from India. Further there is a paucity of studies that have compared the lipid profiles across different types of arthritides. Thus there is a need for an in-depth study of lipid profiles in a spectrum of patients with arthritides in our endemic setting.</p>
            <p id="paragraph-278878c1d2ad4d55b61a7c9a9d2728de">The current study was carried out with an objective to investigate the lipid profile in patients with various types of arthritides, also to assess whether there is a correlation between disease activity and treatment given with the levels of different lipid fractions in these patients and compared with age and sex matched controls.</p>

            <p id="paragraph-c9560f3d18044a8d919135ef851ff6a1">This study was carried out in the Department of Pathology at Tertiary Care Hospital, Mumbai for the period of one year. The data for this study was collected from patients who presented to Rheumatology Department on outpatient basis. A total 150 patients of age between 21 to 50 years, suffering from various types of arthritides were included in the study. 75 apparently healthy, non-smoking volunteers, proportionally matched for age and sex were studied as a control group. These subjects were selected from blood donors and the general population. An informed written consent was taken from case and healthy controls. Known case of Diabetes Mellitus or RBS &gt; 200mg/dl or FBS.&gt; 126 mg/dl or PPB S&gt; 200 mg/dl, hypertension, alcoholics, smokers, known case of kidney diseases, ischaemic heart disease/cerebrovascular accident, endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism, cushing's syndrome, history of use of steroids, oral contraceptives, diuretics beta-blockers, thyroxine and those having history of familial dyslipidemia were excluded from the study.  </p>
            <p id="paragraph-a7c2249092d14acfb4bec691b06ab379">All the selected cases were referred to the pathology laboratory for RA factor estimation. A clinical history, all relevant examination, radiological examination (if any) and other investigations (ESR, HLA B- 27, CRP, and ANA etc) were done for all the patients and treatment history was noted in case record forms. </p>
            <p id="paragraph-c5a005b51d164bf7a4c9111d6f4ca671">The blood samples were drawn from all the patients after a minimum of 12 hour of complete fasting. About 3 ml of blood was drawn using perfectly dry and sterile syringes. Serum was separated within two hours of collection to prevent artifactua I changes in concentration of HDL. The serum was transferred to centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant clear serum was then pipetted out using dry piston pipettes with disposable tips and stored in dry thin walled vials at 4°C. The samples were analyzed the same day or within 48 hours. Care was taken to exclude the hemolysed serum. </p>
            <p id="paragraph-acc86f3a5ceb4712a4dd32d1b99ab6e1">RA factor test was done in all of 150 cases. Normal RF test results are indicated by rheumatoid factor levels that are less than 10 u/mL or by a ratio of less than 1:8 titre (i.e. the concentration of RF antibodies). Estimation of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG) were done enzymatically with commercially available kit on Randox Daytona system. Concentration of VLDL was calculated using the formula, VLDL=Triglyceride/5 and LDL-c holesterol was calculated by using the Friedewald’s equation, LDL=Total cholesterol-[(Triglycerides/5) +HDL] mg/dl.<xref id="xref-df0fbadfd2f44ae699958c47ec4fb5fa" rid="R62107014520152" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The normal values of the lipid parameters used in current study were based on NCEP guidelines.</p>

                <p id="paragraph-061422dbabf44b509db5c95d5ffbbb55">Student t test has been used to test the homogeneity of age and Chi-square test used to find the homogeneity of sex between case and control. Student t test has been used to find the significance of lipid profiles between case and controls. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used to find the significance of mean lipid profiles when there are more than 2 groups. Mann Whitney U test has been carried out to find the significance between case and control for TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratio. Statistical significance was taken when p value &lt; 0.05. The statistical software used for the analysis was SPSS 17.0. </p>
